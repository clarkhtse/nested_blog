### Services

I specialize in providing engineering services with primary focus on web
application development. I am strongly passionate about web standards
and creating amazing experiences.

**I can build your ideas into products.**

I love turning ideas into working applications. Got a product idea
that's stuck into your head? Want to have it prototyped?  Dream of
launching it? I would be more than glad to help you.
