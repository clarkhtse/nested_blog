  <p>I&#39;ve been freelancing for a short time now. Just wanted to try myself at it, maybe create some interesting real-world projects &amp; earn some money. I&#39;d like to share my thoughts on it.</p>

<h3>Finding clients is not hard</h3>

<p>I just occasionally browse freelancing sites for several minutes. Sometimes I see nothing interesting. But when I see one, I just apply to it.</p>

<h3>Portfolio ain&#39;t a requirement</h3>

<p>I have heard many times from people that due to lack of portfolio they won&#39;t hired. That might be truth for some projects, however, even good-paying projects I&#39;ve applied to rare ask for a portfolio.</p>

<h3>Clients like to communicate</h3>

<p>They like when I update them on every single small change. It creates some effect of nice contractor in their eyes if I communicate often with them, am polite, etc.</p>

<h3>Clients are nice</h3>

<p>At least the ones I&#39;ve worked with. Neither of them did tend to ask stupid questions, do silly things, behave impolite.</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>I tend to think that while freelancing I have quite more spare time. Yeah, really.</p>

<p>Freelancing also gives me some feel of freedom: I work for whoever I want, I work whenever I want, I work as much as I want. And get paid for doing things I love doing.</p>
