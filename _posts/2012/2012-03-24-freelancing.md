I've been freelancing for a short time now. Just wanted to try myself at it, maybe create some interesting real-world projects & earn some money. I'd like to share my thoughts on it.

### Finding clients is not hard

I just occasionally browse freelancing sites for several minutes. Sometimes I see nothing interesting. But when I see one, I just apply to it.

### Portfolio ain't a requirement

I have heard many times from people that due to lack of portfolio they won't hired. That might be truth for some projects, however, even good-paying projects I've applied to rare ask for a portfolio.

### Clients like to communicate

They like when I update them on every single small change. It creates some effect of nice contractor in their eyes if I communicate often with them, am polite, etc.

### Clients are nice

At least the ones I've worked with. Neither of them did tend to ask stupid questions, do silly things, behave impolite.

## Thoughts

I tend to think that while freelancing I have quite more spare time. Yeah, really.

Freelancing also gives me some feel of freedom: I work for whoever I want, I work whenever I want, I work as much as I want. And get paid for doing things I love doing.
